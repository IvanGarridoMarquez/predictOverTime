first_year=first year of the data
fix the hypothetical current year=curr_yr
get all examples up to curr_yr(included)=pre_train_set
get feature space from pre_train_set
vectorize the pre_train_set in feature space
weight=1
for each year since curr_year until the first_year
	train_set+=weight samples in pre_train_set which belong to year (sample * weight)
	weight*=2/3
train multi-label classifier=predictor
get all posterior examples to curr_yr=test_set
vectorize the test_set in feature space
test predictor with test_set
evaluate
register the results
